            <p className=" m-2">
            I'm a seasoned professional with a background in finance and a passion for IT.
            I spent three years as a financial analyst (2016-2019) before diving into the tech world with a React.js internship in 2019-2020.<br/>
            <br/>
            Post-internship, I ventured into entrepreneurship, launching a cafe during the pandemic.
            Simultaneously, I delved into freelancing, creating dynamic and static websites, including WordPress projects.<br/>
            <br/>
            In 2021, I pursued an MBA in IT, completing it in 2023. Alongside my studies, I continued freelancing, applying 
            my skills to real-world scenarios.<br/>
            <br/>
            Now actively seeking opportunities, I bring a unique blend of financial insight and tech expertise.<br/> <br/>
